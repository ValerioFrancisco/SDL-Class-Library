		SDL Library Notes

- Class ErrorTracker: This class serves as an internal error tracking object
  that can be used for easier debugging. Initialy only a bool was used, but
  given that SDL, SDL_Image and others have different functions, this class
  helps to keep all encapsulated and less error prone.


- Class Init: This class initializes SDL subsystems, the default constructor
  inits the basic video mode.
  	
- Class Window: Takes care of basic SDL window creation and update.

- Class Surface: Takes care of SDL_Surface pointers and managed memory. This
  helps to prevent leaks.

These classes are to be enriched along the way, first need to implement the
ErrorTracker in all other classes as this was developed after those.
